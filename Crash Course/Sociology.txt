13
Social development
Freud: id, ego, super-ego
Piaget: sensorimotor(sense), pre-operational(cognition), concrete operational(others, causality), formal operational(abstract, logic and critical thinking)
Kohlberg: pre-conventional(self-interest), conventional(societal ethics), post-conventional(judgement)
Gilligan: boys - right and wrong - justice perspective vs. girls - interpersonal reasoning in moral decisions - care and responsibility perspective
Mead: “self” established on “others”, imitation - play - game(multi-role) - against “generalised others”(multi-role, multi-situation)
Erikson: toddler - autonomy, young - intimidate relationships, adulthood (details?)

14 socialisation:
anticipatory
secondary: “hidden curriculum”
Coleman: peer groups(nerds, jocks, leading crowd, and burnouts)
social prescription
Erving Goffman: total institution, e.g. military, prisons, boarding schools, or psychiatric institutions, using rules, rewards and punishment to re-socialise

family, school, peers, media, total institution

15
hold a status(ascribed vs. achieved)
perform a role
role strain
role exit

Thomas Theorem by William Thomas and Dorothy Thomas: "If people define situations as real, they are real in their consequences." Social reality created

Erving Goffman: dramaturgical analysis of social interaction
performance
impression management: words, props and nonverbal communication
front vs. backstage

16
Social group
vs. aggregates, categories
primary(essential, close, supportive, end-in-itself, e.g. family and friends) vs. secondary group

individual affecting group - e.g. leader
instrumental vs. expressive leader
authoritarian vs. democratic vs. laissez-faire: difference in group solidarity, affection/respect to leader, decision creativity, response and efficiency in crisis

group affecting individuals - conformity
authority, autonomy
group norms, values, “groupthink” mentality
reference group: in-group vs. out-group comparison
size <-> impacts and dynamics
size <-> social diversity: homo(inward, concentrating relationship) vs. hetero(intergroup interaction)

groups as networks: people are interconnected


17
formal organisation
utilitarian, normative(voluntary), coercive

rationalization in formal organisation: bureaucracy
bureaucratic ritualism: end in itself, self-perpetuating; oligarchy
Robert Michelle: iron law of oligarchy
Max Weber: bureaucratic alienation(the worst danger) - dehumanizing

Frederik Taylor: scientific management
Organizational environment: e.g. technology, policy and economic trends, population patterns
Changes: creative freedom, flexibility, flattening hierarchies, independent thinking
George Ritzer: McDonaldization of society - hyper-rational fast-food industry principles(efficiency, predictability, uniformity, control)
Irrationality of rationality

18
deviation
biological/psychological perspective: individual factor v.s. sociology
social control, positive/negative sanction
Walter Reckless: containment theory

1. What is "deviated" varies over time/across cultures
2. Deviation is defined/considered/labeled, not innate
3. Social definition involves social power

19
Emile Durkheim's structural functionalism
1. helps define cultural values and norms
2. clarifies moral boundary
3. brings society together
4. encourages social change

Robert Merton
Strain theory: the amount of deviance depends on whether the society has provided sufficient means to achieve cultural defined goals
e.g. the American Dream: financial success
1) accept goal but use unacceptable means ("innovation")=deviant
2) give up on the goal, follow the rules=ritualism
3) reject goals and means=retreatism, "drops out"; in particular:
3a) rebellion=rejection in the context of a counterculture - new goal new means

Symbolic Interaction
Labeling theory: deviance or conformity is about how people label it

e.g. Erving Goffman: stigma=a powerfully negative master status that affects a person's self-concept, social identity, and interactions
- retrospective labeling
- prospective labeling

Differential association: learning what is deviant through interaction with others
Control theory: deviance in terms of self-control, ability to predict/manage consequences

Conflict theory
Defining deviation involves power
Norms have an inherently political nature, i.e. morals(right/good/normative) defined with underlying political belief
"while we may take issue with how a law is applied, we much more rarely ask whether the laws themselves are just or not"

20 Crime
Crimes against the person, against property, and victimless crimes
over-criminalisation
The criminal justice system: the police, the courts and the system of punishment and corrections
Mass incarceration
Punishment, i.e. crime control: retribution (as moral vengeance), deterrence (to reduce crime by making the prospect of getting caught sufficiently awful), societal protection (long prison sentences or capital punishment), rehabilitation

21
Social stratification
- a characteristic of society and not a matter of individual differences
- persists across generations
- hierarchy vs. mobility: horizontal vs. vertical, structural vs. frictional(?)
- stratification as a belief
Open vs. closed society, achieved vs. ascribed position
e.g. India’s Caste system, feudal Europe, South Africa’s apartheid

socioeconomic status: income, education, occupational prestige
status inconsistency (if consider position->status), e.g. poor professors

22
Structural functionalism
Davis-Moore thesis: society assigns greater economic and social rewards to jobs more important to the society.

Conflict theory
Karl Marx:  stratification is based on different relations to the means of production; proletariat would overthrow the bourgeoisie once the exploitation grew worse
Criticism by Ralf Dahrendorf:
1. Capitalist class in Europe has been too fragmented to serve as a single target. People invest in capitalism in a variety of ways
2. Greater legal protections have lessened the tension
3. People ideologically invest in - this determines HOW people seek changes

Symbolic interaction (micro level)
Max Weber: “conspicuous consumption”, as a sign of class
“fit the culture”

23
social stratification plays out in the US: income inequality, wealth inequality, political power, occupational prestige, and education attainment
meritocracy: social stratification based on personal merit

26
mobility
intra-generaltional vs. intergeneraltional
absolute vs. relative
quantitative vs. qualitative
horizontal vs. vertical
social mobility varies among different groups
401k plan: retirement savings plan by an employer in the form of tax-deferred investment options

#FirstWorldProblems
global stratification
GDP=Gross Domestic Product
GNI=Gross National Income
Explanations for global poverty
- technology
- population growth
- gender inequalities
- social stratification
- global power relationships e.g. colonialism and neo
- ialism (economic exploitation by corporations)

28
Modernisation theory
from structural functionalism: frames global stratification as a function of technological and cultural differences between nations
- Columbian exchange
- Industrial revolution
Poverty: societal inadaptability, tradition vs. technological change
Walt Rostow: European modernisation in 4 stages
- the Traditional Stage
- the Take-off Stage
- the Drive to Technological Maturity
- High Mass Consumption
criticisms: there are countries left behind; Eurocentric, economic progress emphasising

Dependency theory
from conflict theory: the rich comes at the expense of the poor
- colonism
Immanuel Wallerstein: the Capitalist World Economy
- economic dependency: high-income countries as “core” and low/middle-income “periphery/semi-periphery”
Poverty: bad distribution
criticisms: world economy is not a zero-sum game; colonisation effect varies

{comparison}
Structural Functionalism view: inteprets as funtional constructs, always based on a questionable standard/assumption
Conlict Theory view: emphasises interaction/relationship and conflict, overlooks individual factors and symbiosis

29
Economics: 3 sectors, raw materials -> manufactured goods -> service
Major revolutions: Agrarian, Industrial (1800s), Information
industrialists as “robber baron”
Labor market: Primary vs. secondary

30 Politics
Politics=
1. society organizes decision-making
2. distributes power and resources
Max Weber:
- government having coercive power that is "the ability to achieve desired ends over the objections of others"
- state as "the organization that has a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence"

Types of authority:
- traditional
- rational-legal
- charismatic
	- routinization of charisma: transformation into traditional/rational-legal authority, e.g. the church after Jesus

Political systems:
- democracy
- authoritarianism: system that denies people participation in their own governance and leaves ruling to the elites
	- monarchy
	- totalitarianism
Political Spectrum: left-leaning/liberal vs. right-leaning/conservative (laissez-faire)

Political organizations: 
- formal institution politics
- special interest groups

Theories of power:
- Pluralist model: negotiation, structural-functionalist
- Power-Elite model: power concentrated in the hands of elites; protest is justifiable
- Marxist Political Economy model: cause of power imbalance is SYSTEMIC, change to be made by changing underlying economic system


31 Sex and Sexuality
primary vs. secondary sex characteristics: whether directly related to reproduction

as an identity
- transgender
- cisgender

- queer theory


32 Sex Stratification
Patriarchy vs. matriarchal: single sex domination
Sexism: one gender is *innately* better
Raewyn Connel: hegemonic masculinities, emphasized femininities^
- anticipatory socialisation
- Arlie Hochschild: the Second Shift
- ^ women to be desirable to men

33 Gender
Social functionalism:
- natural division of labour -> institutionalised
- Talcott Parsons: complimentary to be stable and productive, instrumental vs. expressive qualities
	- criticism: heteronormative, Western perspective on family, binary, maintaining rigid gender role also has costs

Symbolic-interactionism:
- gender is an action
- masculinity/femininity reflects and reinforces gender stratification
- criticism: micro

Social conflict theory:
- Harriet Martineau
Gender as a structural system that distribute power and privilege to some and disadvantage to others: specifically, the patriarchy
- rationality/emotionality stereotype
- intersectionality: multiple dimensions of disadvantage
- Feminism: three major schools of thought:
	- liberal feminism: cultural and political rights and opportunities
	- socialist feminism: capitalism is the foundation of the patriarchy, advocates for full economic equality in the socialist tradition
	- radical feminism: elimination of gender; *clashed heavily with other feminisms, accused transgender movement of perpetuating patriarchal gender norms, refuse to acknowledge transgender people
  
  34 Race & Ethnicity
“One-drop”: having one small black ancestry = not considered white

ethnicity族: culture-based (including language) e.g. Vietnamese vs. Japanese
race种: biology-based, e.g. Johann Friedrich Blumenbach:
- Caucasian/white

Discrimination: behaviourial, any unequal treatment of different groups of people
individual vs. institutional racism

Scapegoat Theory

- prejudice as a defense mechanism on the part of frustrated people who blame another, more disadvantaged group for the troubles that they face (even structural-change-caused ones), out of triggers like economic anxiety

Authoritarian Personality Theory
- proposed by Theodor Adorno during WWII
- prejudice as the outgrowth of a certain personality profile: authoritarianism or conservativeness

Culture Theory
- cultural osmosis (natural tendency?)
- they just like quoting Avenue-Q???
- Emory Bogardus’ social distance scale: psychological distance with another race/ethnicity increases prejudice likelihood

Conflict Theory
- prejudice results from power conflicts among groups
- Four ways of interaction: pluralism, assimilation (minority adopting majority culture), segregation (de jure vs. de facto segregation), and genocide

36 Aging
Biologically:
- James Fries: compression of morbidity
- error (a.k.a. wear and tear, accumulated cell damage) vs. programming (a.k.a. aging clock, declining organisms)

residential choice: patrilocality (societies with frequent warfare) vs. matrilocality, vs. neolocality (after industrialisation)
To trace descent through whose family tree: patrilineal vs. matrilineal
name, inheritance pattern, firstborn

Family as a social institution:

Structural functionalism
- supporting children
- regulation of sexual activity (defining improper ones as taboo)

Social conflict
- perpetuates social inequality
- married women been seen as sexual/economical property of husbands (原文说sexual regulation是原因，但regulation是双方的、反而是natural role of woman in child-bearing decides inequality/dependency, institutionalisation of this bond/relationship enhances the impression, making it look more like property ownership.)
- entrenches social advantages/disadvantages: like marries like
Endogamy and Anti-miscegenation laws (outlawing interracial marriage)

Symbolic interactionism
- family status/role, stereotype
- social exchange theory: cost-benefit calculation
